# {{PROJECT_NAME}} — Claude Code Instructions

## Quick Context
{{PROJECT_DESCRIPTION}}

**Tech Stack:** {{TECH_STACK}}

### START (Every Session)
1. Read this file (CLAUDE.md)
2. Read `.planning/STATE.md` for current status
3. Read `.planning/ROADMAP.md` for milestone progress
4. Read active PRD from `.planning/prds/` for current milestone (if one exists)

## Execution Rules
- **Plan before building.** For non-trivial work, read the milestone's PRD in `.planning/prds/` before touching anything.
- **Delegate immediately.** If a task touches 3+ files, spawn an agent team within your first 2 tool calls.
- **Verify everything.** Run {{VERIFY_COMMANDS}} after agent work lands. Nothing is done until proven.

## Git Workflow
- All changes via PR. Never commit directly to main.
- Branch naming: `fix/short-description` or `feat/short-description`

## Session-End Docs (MANDATORY)
1. `.planning/STATE.md` — replace session notes (don't append), keep <80 lines
2. `.planning/ROADMAP.md` — update phase progress
3. `tasks/lessons.md` — add new one-liner lessons, enforce max 10 cap (promote to Learned Rules when full)
4. Commit doc updates to feature branch

## Learned Rules
<!-- Max 15 permanent one-liners promoted from tasks/lessons.md -->

## Critical Rules
- No assumptions — ask if requirements unclear
- Fight entropy — leave code better than you found it
